NAME
    Geo::StreetAddress::US - Perl extension for parsing US street addresses

DESCRIPTION
    Geo::StreetAddress::US is a regex-based street address and street
    intersection parser for the United States. Its basic goal is to be as
    forgiving as possible when parsing user-provided address strings.
    Geo::StreetAddress::US knows about directional prefixes and suffixes,
    fractional building numbers, building units, grid-based addresses (such
    as those used in parts of Utah), 5 and 9 digit ZIP codes, and all of the
    official USPS abbreviations for street types and state names.
